## installation

To install Lodash into your project, use npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install lodash
```

## Chunk-an-array

1. Chunk an Array
The _.chunk function splits an array into groups of a specified size. If the array cannot be divided evenly, the final chunk will contain the remaining elements.

## Merge-objects

2. Merge Objects
The _.merge function deeply merges two or more objects. If objects have overlapping properties, values from later objects will overwrite the earlier ones.

## Find-in-a-collection

3. Find in a Collection
The _.find function returns the first element in a collection (array or object) that matches the provided predicate (condition).

## Remove-duplicate-values

4. Remove Duplicate Values
The _.uniq function removes duplicate values from an array, ensuring that each value only appears once.

## Debounce-function-calls

5. Debounce Function Calls
The _.debounce function limits how often a function is executed. It's useful for events like button clicks or input fields, where you want to avoid calling a function too frequently.
