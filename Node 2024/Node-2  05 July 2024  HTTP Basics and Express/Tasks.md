# Task 3 (example-3)


## 1. What is Express.js, and why should I use it?
**Answer:** Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building web servers by handling common tasks such as routing, middleware configuration, and handling HTTP requests and responses.

## 2. How do you set up a basic Express server?
**Answer:** To set up a basic Express server, you first need to install Express using npm (`npm install express`). Then, create a simple server in a `server.js` file:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});

```

## 3. What is middleware in Express, and how do you use it?
**Answer:** Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They are used for logging, authentication, handling errors, etc.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(logger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Middleware!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## 4. How can you handle different HTTP methods in Express?
**Answer:** In Express, you handle different HTTP methods using functions like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, and `app.delete()`.

```javascript
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to /users');
});

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to /users');
});

app.put('users:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`PUT request to users${req.params.id}`);
});

app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`DELETE request to users ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

## 5. What are routes, and how do you define them in Express?
**Answer:** Routes in Express define the endpoints of your application and specify what should happen when a user visits a particular URL.

```javascript
app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is the about page');
});
```

## 6. How do you handle query parameters in Express?
**Answer:** Query parameters are handled using `req.query`. They can be accessed via the `req.query` object.

```javascript
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  const query = req.query.q;
  res.send(`You searched for: ${query}`);
});
```

## 7. What is `req.params` in Express?
**Answer:** `req.params` is an object containing route parameters (i.e., named placeholders in the URL that capture values).

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID is: ${userId}`);
});
```

## 8. How do you handle form data in Express?
**Answer:** Use middleware such as `express.urlencoded()` for URL-encoded data and `express.json()` for JSON data
```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  const formData = req.body;
  res.send(`Form data received: ${JSON.stringify(formData)}`);
});
```

## 9. How do you handle errors in Express?
**Answer:** Use error-handling middleware functions, which take four arguments: `err`, `req`, `res`, and `next`.

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});
```

## 10. How can you serve static files in Express?
**Answer:** Use the `express.static` middleware to serve static files from a specified directory.

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

## 11. What are the best practices for securing an Express application?
**Answer:** Use HTTPS, validate and sanitize input data, use `helmet` for setting HTTP headers, prevent SQL injection and XSS, and use secure authentication mechanisms.

## 12. How do you set up CORS in Express?
**Answer:** Use the `cors` middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```

## 13. How do you implement route parameters in Express?
**Answer:** Route parameters are placeholders in the route path, denoted by a colon (`:`).

```javascript
app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.userId;
  const bookId = req.params.bookId;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}, Book ID: ${bookId}`);
});
```

## 14. What is the difference between `app.use()` and route-specific methods like `app.get()` or `app.post()`?
**Answer:** `app.use()` is for middleware that runs for all HTTP methods, whereas `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc., handle specific HTTP methods.

## 15. How do you implement redirection in Express?
**Answer:** Use the `res.redirect()` method to redirect to a different route or URL.

```javascript
app.get('/old-route', (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/new-route');
});
```

## 16. How can you set and retrieve cookies in Express?
**Answer:** Use the `cookie-parser` middleware to handle cookies.

```javascript
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
app.use(cookieParser());

app.get('/set-cookie', (req, res) => {
  res.cookie('username', 'Susheel');
  res.send('Cookie has been set');
});

app.get('/get-cookie', (req, res) => {
  const username = req.cookies.username;
  res.send(`Cookie value: ${username}`);
});
```

## 17. What is `next()` in Express, and when should you use it?
**Answer:** `next()` passes control to the next middleware function. Use it to continue the flow of control in the application.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('This middleware is executed for every request');
  next();
});
```

## 18. How do you implement file uploads in Express?
**Answer:** Use middleware like `multer` to handle file uploads.

```javascript
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded successfully');
});
```

## 19. What are HTTP status codes, and how do you send them in Express?
**Answer:** Use `res.status()` to set the status code and send a response.

```javascript
app.get('/success', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## 20. How can you handle JSON data in Express?
**Answer:** Use `express.json()` middleware to parse incoming JSON requests.

```javascript
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  const jsonData = req.body;
  res.send(`Received JSON data: ${JSON.stringify(jsonData)}`);
});
```

## 21. What is the `express.Router` and how is it used?
**Answer:** `express.Router` is a mini Express application for organizing routes and middleware into modular route handlers.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Users list');
});

app.use('/api', router);
```

## 22. How do you manage sessions in Express?
**Answer:** Use `express-session` middleware to manage sessions and store user data.

```javascript
const session = require('express-session');

app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: true }
}));
```

## 23. How do you handle errors in asynchronous code in Express?
**Answer:** Pass the error to the next middleware using `next(error)`.

```javascript
app.get('/async-error', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Async operation
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});
```
