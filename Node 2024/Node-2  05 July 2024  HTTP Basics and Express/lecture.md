create a server
--> get request from client and i wilt send back response
--> client can request anytime i have to continuously listen yo incoming
requests.

--> server it's a process (system process) i have to give it a port number.


problem : Every change we need to  rerunning the server but this is ot a good thing

Solution : external modules --> store (npm) nodemon node mon node monitor it will monitor the changes in the file
